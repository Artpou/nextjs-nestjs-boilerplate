- biome pattern for imports is:
```
"groups": [
    ":NODE:",
    ":BLANK_LINE:",
    ["react", "react/**", "next", "next/**"],
    ":BLANK_LINE:",
    ["**", "!@workspace/**", "!@/**", "!./**"],
    ":BLANK_LINE:",
    ["@workspace/**", "!@workspace/ui/**"],
    ":BLANK_LINE:",
    ["@workspace/ui/**"],
    ":BLANK_LINE:",
    ["@/**"],
    ":BLANK_LINE:",
    ["./**"]
]
```
